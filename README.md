# FOR CREATERS

---

**Lacking the money to bring your Creative Venture to Life?**

**Crypto Crowdfund** Campaigns will help you turn your creative ideas into
reality! It's where _creators share new visions for creative work with the
communities that will come together to fund them_.

No matter what, creators always control how the work comes together: _no
100-page grant applications_, _no donors demanding you modify your message_,
_no last-minute edits from investors_. When backers chip in funding and help
spread the word, they too become part of these independent works.

# FOR INVESTERS

**Worried about being Conned by Fake Campaigns?**

**Crypto Crowdfund** brings power to the Investors as well! Backed by the
razor-edge security of **BlockChain** Technology, _only after the majority of
the investors have approved a Transaction Request, the transaction can be
processed_.

\_No more being scammed by Fake Campaigns!
